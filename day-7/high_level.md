# Ceaser Cipher
For The Ceaser Cipher example the Following would be my Process

- Make a method that accepts a string and number as arguments.
- Inside method create array that has each letter in an individual element
- Use a each_char method to iterate over each character
- For each character find its index in alphabet array
- Traverse array the amount designated from the parameters and return new letter
- Capture that interation of all the characters in a variable
- Return that variable
